# Calculator
Calculator/Keypad code done in REACT.js

##I did this project because I seen some examples for it floating around online and thought it would be a fun REACT app.
##The main reason I implemented this code is because I want to get beter with Unit Testing and Mocking within a Unit Test. 

One of the essential parts of unit testing is to isolate or insulate the unit being tested. So that test results are not affected by external events or the
environment. Like availability of server side API's or external resources or other child/parent components. 
To enable such isolation all testing frameworks provide capabilities to mock artifacts. So that our tests focus on testing one unit at a time. 

Thank you for your interest in my repository!
